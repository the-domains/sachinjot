Paul, 84, performed the role of a 'pandit' by reading out wedding 'mantras', as top Hungarian ministers were among over 600 guests at the wedding reception in the Buda Castle in Budapest. Music included popular numbers from India, Pakistan and Hungary.
Swraj Paul told "I have known Hungary since 1954 and we used the occasion to discuss potential investment in the country. It felt like the whole of Hungary rose to occasion and the wedding became the talk of the town". 

Guests included Hungarian national development minister Miklós Seszták, deputy minister for foreign affairs and trade László Szabó, deputy speaker István Jakab, Indian ambassador Rahul Chabra, and the British embassy deputy head of mission Adam Kettle-Williams.
The two Hungarian ministers and their families joined the 'sangeet' and 'mehndi' ceremonies, Paul said.
